## Dependency

+ TensorFlowï¼ˆ>=1.4)
+ OpenCV
+ Matplotlib

The recommended way to install the dependency is
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparation

Please use the following Google Drive link to download the datasets: [[drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13mokTHTuHOLKnztVv1PKjBpdIEGaUqWv?usp=sharing). There are two files : `data.tar.gz` and `ShapeNetVox32.tar.gz`. Please download both of them and uncompressed it into the project root directory:
```bash
tar -xvf ShapeNetVox32.tar.gz
tar -xvf data.tar.gz
rm ShapeNetVox32.tar.gz
rm data.tar.gz
```

## Training

In order to train a model, please use `train.py` script. The default hyper-parameter are stored in `config.py`, and all the training settings are stored in `training_settings.py`. For example, to train single category chairs with 50% pose annotations, we could use:
```bash
python train.py --data chairs_pose0.5
```
where `chairs_pose0.5` refers to an entry in the `training_settings.py` file.

The `scripts` folder contains command line arguments for running different experiments. Note that each script contains multiple training commands.

For example, in order to run *all* the single category training with 50% of pose annotations, please use:
```bash
./scripts/single_category.sh
```

To train *all* multi-category models or to pre-train *all* models for few-shot transfer learning, please use:
```bash
./scripts/muti.sh
```

## Evaluation

File `inference.py` contains codes to load a trained model and evaluate on specific data split or categories. `scripts/get_score.py` helps to organize the evaluation scores into `.csv` files. For Detail usage, please refer to `scripts/eval_*.sh`.

For example, if you want to evaluate *all* the single category training experiments, try running
```bash
./sripts/eval_single_category.sh
```

## Results

Following results are reported from the testing set. Please compare to these results during reproduction.
